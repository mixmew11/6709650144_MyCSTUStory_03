                        I want to work in a career that I love. By having the opportunity to grow and develop yourself continuously.
                         which can allow me to participate in creating new innovations and help develop society.
                        I want to have a balance in my life between work and play. I have time for family and friends.
                         I want to take care of my health regularly.
